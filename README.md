# Exploring-Volatile-and-Sychronization
I recently suggested the use of `Volatile` as a form of synchronization as I hear so much. However, I have found through experimentation that volatile is actually never  a reliable form of sychronization.

is one such example that misleads the user into thinking that `Voaltile` will allow for atomic operations on fields which is incorrect. 

Volatile use cases:

since `volatile` doesn't sychronize operations on your fields what is it good for? `volatile` can be used to minimize the chance of a race condition occuring and depending on your application, that change can be extremely low, but it will never be zero. Therefore, the use case for volatile is null. Never use `volatile` unless you want to make your code more readable. It does nothing if you already implement synchronization into your program.
